## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or create a new React application.

2. Navigate to the `src` directory of your React application.

3. Create a new React functional component named `InputsEvent.jsx`.

4. Inside the `InputsEvent.jsx` component, implement the following tasks:

   - Implement an `onChange` event handler function named `handleInputChange`. This function should log the name of the input field and its new value to the console when the input value changes.

   - Implement an `onClick` event handler function named `handleButtonClick`. This function should log a message to the console when the button is clicked.

   - Render the following elements within the component:
     - Four input fields. Attach the `handleInputChange` function to their `onChange` event.
     - One textarea element. Attach the `handleInputChange` function to its `onChange` event.
     - One button element. Attach the `handleButtonClick` function to its `onClick` event.

5. Open the browser ,you have to see your inputs.

6. Enter different values in the input fields and observe the console logs for input value changes.

7. Click the button and observe the console log for the button click event.

## Challenge (Optional)

For an extra challenge, modify the component to display the changed values in real-time on the page itself. Update the text content of the component according to the changes in input values and button clicks.

Good luck and happy coding! ðŸš€
